                <h2>Saltmarsh</h2>
                <p>
                    Saltmarsh is a small fishing vileage on a small island on the
                    Sea of Swords, off the Sword Coast of Faer&ucirc;n. The recent
                    rise of the Sea Princes has placed Saltmarsh under a greater
                    threat of piracy and other nefarious criminal activity.

                <h2>Mount Hotenow</h2>
                <p>
                    Mount Hotenow known to the ancient dwarves as Glaurimm, is the
                    volcano prison of the Primordial Maegera which stands amid the
                    Crags mountain range, situated to the northeast of the city of
                    Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North, deep in Neverwinter Wood.
                    It was home to a large population of fire elementals, warming
                    the Neverwinter River to the point where it never froze over,
                    even in the heart of winter. It is now host to the sulfur mines 
                    of the Sea Prince Toli.

                <h2>Waterdeep</h2>
                <p>
                    Waterdeep, also known as the City of Splendors or the Crown of
                    the North, is the most important and influential city in the
                    North and perhaps in all Faer√ªn. It is a truly marvelous
                    cosmopolitan city of great culture that attracted the most
                    talented artisans, artists, and scholars from across the Realms,
                    as well as a commercial hub for financial interests along the
                    coast and beyond. It is one of if not the most powerful and
                    influential states of the Lord's Alliance.

                <h2>Byat Byat</h2>
                <p>
                    Byat Byat is the nere-surface lair of a group of the insaine
                    god creating fish folk known as the Kua-toa which is being
                    used by the Drow to sell enslaved peoples to the Sea Prince
                    Toli and presumably other less savory individuals of the
                    Sword Coast.
