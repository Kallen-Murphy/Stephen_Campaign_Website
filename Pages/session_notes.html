                    The party completed there exploration of the Ghost house defeating
                    the remaining monmurg pirates and discovering two prisoners of the 
                    Pirate Prince Monmurg in the process. These prisoners, Theron Kelvar
                    and Sycndo, helped the party defeat the pirates and proceded to join
                    the crew. The crew then worked with Anders Solmar to make preparations
                    for Monmurg's return. Upon Monmurg's return, the party, with the
                    assistance of Saltmarsh's Town Guard, confronted the priates who made 
                    landfall before infiltrating Monmurg's ship.

                    The party was formed. At the request of the new town leader Anders
                    Solmar, the party investegated the Ghost House: a house used
                    by a group of pirates who spread a myth that the sturcture was 
                    haunted in order to hide their activities. While exploring the house,
                    the party encountered a person claiming to be a victim of the pirates.
                    This suposed victim turned out to be a member of the pirate crew, 
                    Ned Shakeshaft. Shakeshaft betraid the party imprsoning them in the 
                    basement where Shad Evergreen was tragicaly killed
