                        on all major platforms through dedicated apps in adition to a browser based
                        web app. Discord offers a variety of comunication methods such as text, voice,
                        and video chats in adition to other built in features such as screen sharing
                        and the ability to create servers specific nicknames and roles for member.
                        Furthur fucntionality can also be added through the use of outside bots
